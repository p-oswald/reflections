When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

* remotly accessable content means you can work from everywhere
* you could open your work to other ppl easily
* several ppl can have access from several locations

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

* to be sure that you do not overwrite data
* to not send unnecesary data
* to be able to decide when to push/pull

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

# fork: * creates a clone that is linked the source
        * is used to get a clone that you can work on without permission to change the source
        * used on github to reference to the source of the clone

# clone: * creates a copy of a source
         * can exist locally or on github
         * is used to get the copy of a source without referencing it
         * used on github and locally

# branch: * creates a clone from a master locally
          * master and branches are connected and can be fused again later
          * used locally to try out new code without destroying the master, can be merged again
